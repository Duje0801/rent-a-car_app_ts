This web application is designed for renting oldtimers in Croatia. Website allows users to browse cars for rent, compare prices, add packages (additional driver, border crossing etc.), chat with customer service and make reservations.

To develop this application, I used HTML, SCSS, and Javascript (React, Typescript). I also integrated the React Date Picker library for selecting rental dates.

The design is fully responsive for various screen sizes, making it easy to use on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
