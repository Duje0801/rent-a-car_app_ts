          was very impressed with the service. The entire rental process was seamless and the 
          staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.
          What stood out to me the most was the level of customer service I received. 
          The staff at "Oldtimer" were knowledgeable about the area and gave me some great 
          recommendations for places to visit during my stay in Zadar. They even provided me 
          with a map and directions to my hotel, which was really helpful.`,

              The staff were incredibly helpful and made the rental process so easy and stress-free.
              But what really impressed me was the condition of the cars. They were all in excellent 
              shape and it was clear that "Oldtimer" takes great care in maintaining their vehicles. 
              This was especially important for me as I was embarking on a long road trip through 
              several countries, all the way down to Turkey. Thanks to "Oldtimer," my road trip 
              through Europe was a truly unforgettable experience.

        drive one for as long as I can remember. Oldtimer Rent-a-Car made that dream a reality

        za naše putovanje između Splita i Dubrovnika i ne možemo biti sretniji s tim iskustvom.

        predivna. Osoblje tvrtke Oldtimer rent-a-car bilo je izuzetno korisno i brzo nam je

        decisions we could have made. The service we received from Oldtimer Rent-a-Car 
        was exceptional. They were very responsive and communicative throughout the rental process, 
        which made everything very easy. When we arrived to pick up the car, they gave us a thorough 
        overview of the car and its features. We felt like we were in good hands the whole time. 
        Driving the car was an amazing experience - we got so many compliments and felt like 
        celebrities cruising around town. `,
